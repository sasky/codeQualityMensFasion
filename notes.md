# writing the test 

- always start with GIVEN WHEN THEN 




- test code is not production code 
( think of it more as a play ground/ then as documentation )
- Writing the test feeling out the design ( in constructor , addItem, add Items(), syncItems())

# write the code

- notice how nice it is to get instant feedback ( not setup the state in the web site)

- seeds of bad design,  (SSViewer->process function )

- splitting functions up (class does one thing, a function does one thing) ( uncle bob, Santi Metz)

- favour pure functions , be mindfull of side effects 

-

- throw many errors ( don't try to work around it ) (pragmatic programmers)
